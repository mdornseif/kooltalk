This  is  kooltalk  v2.1,  a  simple text  filter  that  will  transform
sentences like this:

 	"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

into something like this:

 	"+HE (,)U1C|< BR0\/\/|\| /=()X j(_)mPS ()V3R ~|~H[- LA~/_v/ D()9"

or, as an option, into something like this:

 	"th3 qu1ck br0wn ph0x jumpz 0v3r th3 lazy d0g"

If usable at  all, kooltalk will be of some  use when impressing wannabe
hackers.

INSTALLATION:

Check out  the Makefile and change  the paths to your  machine's values.
Run 'make'. Become root and run 'make  install'. Be sure to read the man
page. I think it's funny.

NOTE:

Kooltalk was written for Linux. Porting it to any other UNIXish platform
shouldn't  be a  problem, though.  You might  want to  change the  lines
dealing with srand(3) and time(2) in main().
